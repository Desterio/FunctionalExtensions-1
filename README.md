FunctionalExtensions
====================

This project includes some types and functions that support concepts from functional programming like Option&lt;T&gt; and Choice&lt;T1, T2&gt;.
It also includes a simple validation framework that makes use of the Choice type.
There is a fluent API on top of the validation framework. The grammar looks like this:
